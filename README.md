# House-Price-Prediction-using-Advanced-Regression

Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project for predicting house prices based on various features. Accurate house price prediction is essential for both homebuyers and sellers to make informed decisions. This project employs advanced regression techniques to build a robust predictive model for estimating house prices.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Thorough data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modeling.
Advanced Regression Models: Implementation of advanced regression algorithms, including Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic Net, and Support Vector Regression (SVR).
Model Evaluation: Detailed evaluation of model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score.
Feature Importance Analysis: Examination of feature importance to identify which factors have the most significant impact on house prices.
Deployment: Deployment of the final model as an API, allowing users to predict house prices based on input features.
Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Flask (for API deployment)
HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for a user-friendly web interface)
Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
